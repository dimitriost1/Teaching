		The distance I drive in each of the blocks are given by \begin{align*}

		The sum of these distances is $d_1+d_2=50\text{ miles}$.

The hour hand travels $5$ minutes in the time the minute hand travels $60$: $$\frac{\text{Hour}}{\text{Minute}}=\frac{5}{60}\implies \text{Hour}=\frac{1}{12}\text{Minute}.$$
The hour hand begins at $50$ and the minute hand begins at $0$. Therefore, $$50+\frac{1}{12}m=m\implies m=50\left(\frac{12}{11}\right)=\frac{600}{11}=54\frac{6}{11}.$$
Hence, the time is $10:54:\frac{6}{11}.$

	Let Cassandra's time be $t_c$ and the actual time be $t_t$. We see that $$t_t-t_c=2\cdot 60+24=144\text{ seconds}.$$ Since $t_t=3600\text{ s}$, we see that $$\frac{t_t-t_c}{t_t}=\frac{144}{3600}=\frac{1}{25}\implies \frac{t_c}{t_t}=\frac{24}{25}.$$

 Rearranging $t_t=\frac{25}{24}t_c\implies t_t=\frac{25}{24}t_c$. \medskip
	
	Hence, at time $t_c=10\cdot 60\text{ minutes}$, we have $$t_t=\frac{25}{24}\left(600\text{ minutes}\right)=625 \text{ minutes}\implies t_t=\boxed{10:25 \text{ pm}}.$$

Let the rate it takes Moe be $r_m$, the rate it takes Larry be $r_l$ and the rate it takes Curly be $r_c$. Therefore, we have the system of equations \begin{align*} 1&=\left(r_m+r_l\right)10  \\ 1&=\left(r_l+r_c\right)12 \\ 1&=\left(r_m+r_c\right)15. \end{align*}
Dividing these, we see that $r_m+r_l=\frac{1}{10}$, $r_l+r_c=\frac{1}{12}$, and $r_m+r_c=\frac{1}{15}$: $$2\left(r_m+r_l+r_c\right)=\frac{1}{10}+\frac{1}{12}+\frac{1}{15}=\frac{1}{4}\implies r_m+r_l+r_c=\frac{1}{8}.$$ Hence, it takes all three of them $\boxed{8\text{ hours}}$ working together.

	\mybox{0.95\textwidth}{\begin{exmp} Paula the painter and her two helpers each paint at constant, but different, rates. They always start at 8:00 AM, and all three always take the same amount of time to eat lunch. On Monday the three of them painted 50\% of a house, quitting at 4:00 PM. On Tuesday, when Paula wasn't there, the two helpers painted only 24\% of the house and quit at 2:12 PM. On Wednesday Paula worked by herself and finished the house by working until 7:12 P.M.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{$\star$ Paula the Painter Solution}
	Let Paula's rate be $p$ and her helper's rate be $h$. Let the length of the lunch break be $L$. We thus have the system of equations:
	\begin{align*}
	\left(8-L\right)\left(p+h\right) &=50 \\
	\left(6.2-L\right)h &=24 \\
	\left(11.2-L\right)p &=26. \end{align*} \pause 
	Expanding these gives: \begin{align*} 8p+8h-Lp-Lh &=50 \\
									6.2h-Lh &= 24 \\
									11.2p-Lp&=26. \end{align*} \pause
	Adding the last two equations gives $$6.2h+11.2p-Lh-Lp=50.$$

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{$\star$ Paula the Painter Solution}
Equating the values that are $50$ gives \begin{align*} 8p+8h-Lp-Lh&=6.2h+11.2p-Lh-Lp \\  1.8h&=3.2p \\  h&=\frac{16}{9}p. \end{align*} \pause
Substituting this into the bottom two equations gives: \begin{align*}
\left(6.2-L\right)\frac{16}{9}p & = 24 \\
\left(11.2-L\right)p &=26. \end{align*} \pause
Rearranging the top equation gives $\left(6.2-L\right)p=24\cdot \frac{9}{16}=\frac{27}{2}$. \medskip \pause

 Subtracting from the bottom gives $5p=26-\frac{27}{2}=\frac{25}{2}\implies p=\frac52$. \medskip \pause
 
 Finally, we have $L=\frac{4}{5}\implies L=\boxed{48 \text{ minutes}}.$

	Let the length of the track be $L$. Then, the distance ran is:

	\begin{tabular}{l|l|l}
		& Brenda & Sally \\ \hline
		First Meeting ($t_1$) & $100$ & $L/2-100$ \\
		Second Meeting ($t_2$) & $L-150$ & $150$ 
	\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
Let Brenda's rate be $r_b$ and Sally's rate be $r_s$. From the distance formula:
\begin{alignat*}{2} 100&=r_bt_1, \quad L/2-100&=r_st_1 \\
			   L-150&=r_bt_2, \quad 150&=r_st_2. \end{alignat*}
Dividing these equations, we arrive at the ratios $$\frac{t_1}{t_2}=\frac{100}{L-150}=\frac{L/2-100}{150}\implies L=\boxed{350\text{ meters}}.$$

The girls combined run half the length of the track in their first meeting and the entire length in their second meeting: 
\begin{align*} L/2&=\left(r_b+r_s\right)t_1 \\
			   L&=\left(r_b+r_s\right)t_2. \end{align*}
Therefore, $t_2=2t_1$. For the first meeting, Brenda runs $r_bt_1=100\text{ meters}.$ \medskip 

Hence, in the second meeting, Brenda runs $r_b\left(2t_1\right)=200\text{ meters}$. \medskip

Therefore, the length of the track in meters is $200+150=\boxed{350\text{ meters}}.$
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Sam and Walt}
	Let Sam's rate be $r_s$ and Walt's be $r_w$. Let the first race take time $t_1$: 
$$	\begin{cases} r_st_1&=h \\
			r_wt_1&=h-d \end{cases} \implies r_s=r_w\cdot \frac{h}{h-d}.$$
Let the time it takes Sam to complete the second race be $t_s$. Therefore, \begin{align*} r_st_s&=h+d \\ \pause 
\left(r_w\cdot \frac{h}{h-d}\right)t_s &=h+d \\  \pause
r_wt_s &=\frac{(h+d)(h-d)}{h}. \end{align*}
In time $t_s$, Walt runs a distance $d_w=r_wt_s=\frac{h^2-d^2}{h}=h-\frac{d^2}{h}$. \medskip \pause

Therefore, Sam wins the second race and the answer is $\bm{\frac{d^2}{h}}.$
